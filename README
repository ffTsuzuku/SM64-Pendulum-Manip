This program will simulate how long it takes for a pendulum to reach angle 0. 
This is important because angle 0 causes the pendalum to accerlate. 
It's the angle we need to constantly swing through to gain higher 
pendulum amplitudes. Thats because one we go past angle 0, we will always deaccelerate. 
This program will print out 2 pieces of information, the first being how many frames does it take
for the pendulum to swing through angle 0 without any RNG manipulation. And the Second
is how long will it take the game to orient the pedulum in a position so that is is more than half way 
through a full circle.

COMING SOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
From here, this program will be improved to determine how to use Mario to speedup
this manipulation
